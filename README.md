EUScreen preview app
====================

This app is part of the EUScreen project, it has very little value to outside developers except as a example of code. Its a Html5Application
as defined inside the Multiscreen Tookit and should be deployed as such (check the application manager wiki)

1) Check out smt_euscreenxlpreview in Eclipse
2) Build a war using the 'deploy-war' task with the provided build.xml
3) Do not deploy it in tomcat!, we use the war format but it should be loaded in Lou so use the application manager

** unless you are working on the EUScreen project, probably not much use for this application since you are missing the needed
data inside smithers. But it can be useful for code examples of how todo things with the toolkit so use it as such.
